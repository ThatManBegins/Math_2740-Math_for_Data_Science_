# Getting in touch

- [Julien.Arino@umanitoba.ca](mailto:Julien.Arino@umanitoba.ca)

- Please use your `myumanitoba` email address. Use a tag such as `[MATH 2740]` in your subject line: because of my work on COVID-19, there are days when I receive more than one hundred emails, so if you want to be read..

- There's an entry in the university address book for a phone for me.. don't bother!

- I will be physically present on campus at times, but there will not be any in-person meetings until the end of October when the University's mandate for full vaccination takes effect

# Course website

- All information about the course will be on UMLearn

- It is your responsibility to check the UMLearn site regularly. All announcements about the course will be made there

---

# Lectures

- All lectures will be pre-recorded and available online. I am hoping to be done recording by mid-September

- Lecture times (TR 11:30-12:45) will normally see me online in Zoom to answer questions about the course. Times may change because of work-related obligations. All information will be posted online on UMLearn

- If you cannot attend the "lecture time Zoom", send me an email to arrange a meeting at some other time

---

# Tutorials

- It is strongly recommended to attend tutorials, as this is where you will review some of the mathematical content

- Tutorials are as follows
    - B01	8:30 - 9:20	W
    - B02	9:30 - 10:20	W
    - B03	11:30 - 12:20	W

# Evaluation - Assignments
- Because the course is not in-person, evaluation will be through assignments only
- One assignment per week, which will include a mix of mathematical and computer work
- On assignments, not all questions will be marked (but solutions will be provided to all questions). If you do not submit an answer to a question that is marked, you will receive **zero** for that question
- There will be **no** tolerance for late assignments and there will not be any make-up for missed assignments: any assignment not returned by the deadline will result in a mark of **zero**
- The mark for assignments will consist of the average of the marks on the **best 8** assignments

# Computer work

- Being able to use computers is an integral part of being a data scientist, so in this course, we will use computers a lot
- The main two languages in data science are `R` and `Python`. Typically, `R` is used more by people in Stats, while `Python` is more CS. There is great value in both and knowing both is a plus, but for simplicity, here we will use `R`. As much as possible, I will provide the equivalent code in `Python`, but computer assignments will need to be handed back in `R`

# Computer work - jupyter notebooks on syzygy.ca

- To facilitate computer work, we will use `R` within `jupyter` notebooks on syzygy.ca 
- I will provide a whole lecture on using `jupyter` notebooks and syzygy.ca, for now just know that this is a development environment that runs on the web and to which you have access as U of M students
